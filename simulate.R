# ----- Simulate death data -----
# Build model from the death rates and add a term proportional
# to LSOA's income deprivation.
#
# Poisson death rate model with:
# - Age terms from UK study (Bennett et al. 2015)
# - Temporal component from ONS mortality rates
# - Spatial component from income deprivation (1/4 scale of age effects)
# - Random noise (1/10 scale of age effects)
